# learnt4life

## A tool for memorizing

Based on neuroscience theory for better memorization, learnt4life is a very simple tool designed to help people memorize things that really matters to them.

## Adds reminders in your google calendar

Just add a link or poetry line or whatever you want your brain to memorize and it will pop in your calendar at specific times and you'll learn this information for your whole lifetime.


## Project next step

Project init, I will create a command line or simple webpage POC using the Google Calendar API.
