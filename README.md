# learnt4life

## A tool for memorizing

Based on neuroscience theory for better memorization, learnt4life is a very simple tool designed to help people memorize things that really matter to them.

## A tool that adds reminders automatically in your google calendar

If you want your brain to memorize something (a link to some video, or poetry line or whatever you want), just paste it and it will pop in your calendar at the optimized times that will make you learn it best. Trust the science and you will end up knowing this information for your whole lifetime!


## Project next step

Project init, I will create a command line or simple webpage POC using the Google Calendar API.
